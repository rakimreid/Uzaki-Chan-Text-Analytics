# Data Source

Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! the anime - season 1 and 2.

You can view the anime on Crunchyroll <a href= "https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GNVHKN7KZ/uzaki-chan-wants-to-hang-out">here</a> 


# Data

Here are the data collection steps: 

* Record each episode of Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! seasons 1 and 2. 
* Upload files to <a href = "http://www.temi.com">Temi</a> for transcription
* Download files from Temi upon completion. 
* Review the episode and edit the transcription file (text file/Notepad in Windows). 
* Then save the file.   
* Combine all the files into one


# Tools Used

* R language
* Udpipe language in R
* Power BI (dashboarding)
* Temi (for transcription)


# Evaluation 

Keywords found highlight some of the most pivotal scenes in the series. 

For season 1: They mainly have to do with events 
(e.g. chocolate mint flavor and Golden Week). So, dates, the keywords are about dates featuring the titular characters. 

For season 2: Keywords focus on time heavily. There is a deep exploration of Uzaki's and Sakurai's past, present and (potential) future this season. 


# Conclusion

Transcribing Japanese anime English dubs audio to text is challenging. The transcription accuracy on Temi varied between 75% to 90% and most commonly around 80%. Most of the errors were due to Japanese words. 

This project shows the power of text analytics for foreign media. Often people think an anime, TV show, or other media is trying to communicate one message. But it is really about something else entirely. NLP and text analytics can draw out these themes outside of our awareness into an understandable form. 


# Future Projects

Here are some ideas: 

* Text analytics/NLP with a different algorithms in Python
* Re-translate the English back into Japanese.
* Examine additional seasons of Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! as they release
